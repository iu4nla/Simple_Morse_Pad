# Simple_Morse_Pad
A simple morse pad for training on a computer

As of version 0.1 there are three functions:
- Usb keyboard encoder: it lets you encode a digital input (like a mechanical switch) to a keyboard button. Useful for training on pc programs
- Led breathing light effect: because, even if we are not using it, we want our stuff to be flashy
- Mouse jiggler: because I know some of you guys sometimes need to jiggle your mouse. (I know you do).

Feel free to adapt the code to suit your needs.
